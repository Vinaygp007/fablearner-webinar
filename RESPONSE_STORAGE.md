# Webinar Response Storage System

## Overview

This system automatically stores user responses to webinar questions in Firebase when the webinar ends or the user closes the window.

## How It Works

### 1. Question Display

- Questions appear on screen at specific timestamps during the webinar
- Users can submit text or MCQ responses
- Responses are stored locally in `pendingResponses` state

### 2. Response Storage

- Responses are NOT immediately saved to Firebase
- Instead, they are stored in local state as "pending responses"
- This improves performance and reduces Firebase calls during the webinar

### 3. Automatic Saving Triggers

Responses are automatically saved to Firebase when:

1. **Webinar Ends**: When the video duration is reached
2. **User Closes Window**: When the user closes the browser tab/window
3. **Page Becomes Hidden**: When the user switches tabs or minimizes the browser
4. **Component Unmounts**: When the user navigates away from the page
5. **Manual Save**: User clicks "Save Responses Now" button

### 4. Firebase Storage Structure

```
webinar/{webinarId}/response/{responseId}
{
  userId: string,
  userName: string,
  questionId: string,
  questionType: string,
  response: string,
  timestamp: string,
  createdAt: string,
  updatedAt: string,
  webinarId: string,
  webinarTitle: string
}
```

## User Experience

### During Webinar

- User sees questions appear at specific timestamps
- User submits responses
- User sees "Response saved! (Will be uploaded when webinar ends)"
- User sees yellow indicator showing number of pending responses

### After Webinar

- All responses are automatically uploaded to Firebase
- User can manually save responses using the "Save Responses Now" button
- Console logs show the progress of saving responses

## Technical Implementation

### Key Components

1. **WebinarLive.tsx**: Main component handling response collection
2. **Firebase Integration**: Uses existing `handleResponse` function
3. **Event Listeners**: `beforeunload` and `visibilitychange` events
4. **State Management**: `pendingResponses` state for local storage

### Event Handling

```javascript
// Save when webinar ends
useEffect(() => {
  if (videoDuration !== null && currentVideoTime >= videoDuration) {
    savePendingResponses();
  }
}, [videoDuration, currentVideoTime]);

// Save when user closes window
useEffect(() => {
  const handleBeforeUnload = (event) => {
    if (pendingResponses.length > 0) {
      event.preventDefault();
      event.returnValue = "";
    }
  };

  window.addEventListener("beforeunload", handleBeforeUnload);
  return () => window.removeEventListener("beforeunload", handleBeforeUnload);
}, [pendingResponses]);
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing

1. Start a webinar
2. Wait for questions to appear
3. Submit responses
4. Check that responses appear in pending state
5. Close browser window or end webinar
6. Verify responses are saved to Firebase

### Console Logs

The system provides detailed console logs:

- When responses are added to pending queue
- When saving starts
- Success/failure for each response
- Total count of successful/failed saves

## Error Handling

- If Firebase save fails, error is logged but doesn't break the system
- Responses remain in pending state if save fails
- User can manually retry using "Save Responses Now" button
- Network issues are handled gracefully

## Future Enhancements

- Add retry mechanism for failed saves
- Add offline support with local storage backup
- Add progress indicators for save operations
- Add admin dashboard to view all responses
